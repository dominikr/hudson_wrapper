Simple script for wrapping external Hudson jobs and sending their output to Hudson.

Best used for cron jobs.

This script originated here:  http://blog.markfeeney.com/2010/01/hudson-external-jobs-wrapper-script.html

I added a few simple features:

  1) If a job doesn't exist in Hudson, it will automatically be created.
     
  2) Job names with whitespace are now supported (eg: "My Job #1")
